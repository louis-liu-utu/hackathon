        <p class="main-txt">
            1. THIS IS AN IMPORTANT LEGAL AGREEMENT <br>
            These Terms of Use are a legally binding contract between you and the UTU
            entity specified in Section 14.11 below. They regulate your and our rights, duties
            and liabilities with respect to UTU, including all services, functionality and
            features made available or offered as part of or in connection with UTU and all
            versions thereof (including its web-based and mobile app versions and any
            publicly-accessible blockchain used by UTU). <br>
            You should carefully review these Terms of Use, as well as all other terms and
            conditions, rules, guidelines, policies and requirements that we may publish from
            time to time on UTU or notify to you (including our Privacy Notice, Ground
            Rules and Cookie Notice) (collectively referred to as Policies). You should do this
            before you start using UTU and on a regular basis afterwards.
            Policies are living documents and will evolve and change as UTU develops, so
            they are likely to be updated frequently. You should check them regularly so that
            you are acquainted with the most current versions that apply to your continued
            use of UTU. We will notify you (by email, direct message or notice posted on
            UTU) of any changes to the Terms of Use, Privacy Notice, Ground
            Rules or Cookie Notice that would affect your use of UTU. Policies are intended
            to supplement, rather than conflict with or override these Terms of Use, unless it
            is specifically stated otherwise in a Policy. You must comply with all Policies and
            any breach of a Policy will accordingly constitute a breach of these Terms of
            Use.<br>
            YOU SHOULD IMMEDIATELY CEASE ALL USE OF UTU IF YOU ARE UNCLEAR
            ABOUT ANYTHING IN THESE TERMS OF USE OR ANY OF THE POLICIES, OR
            IF YOU DO NOT AGREE TO ANY OF THEIR TERMS. IF YOU USE OR VIEW ANY
            ASPECT OF UTU, YOU WILL BE DEEMED TO HAVE AGREED TO THESE
            TERMS OF USE AND THE POLICIES.<br>
            2.UTU FEATURES WILL CHANGE<br>
            The services, functionality and features available in UTU will change from time to
            time. We may remove or change existing services, functionality or features, or
            add new ones at any time and for any reason. These changes may happen with
            or without notice to you. We will endeavor to notify you (by email, direct
            message or notice posted on UTU) of any major changes we make.
            We do not commit or guarantee that any services, functionality and features
            available in UTU at any particular point in time will remain available as part of
            UTU.<br>
            3. WHO CAN USE UTU?<br>
            To use UTU, you must be at least 18 years old (or,where the laws of your place
            of residence require you to be older than 18 years old to access and use a
            service such as UTU, you must be at least that age). This is because laws and
            regulations around the world give minors (i.e. under 18s) special treatment and
            we will need to be sure we can meet all requirements before opening UTU to this
            category of user.<br>
            The full features and functionality of UTU are available only to our users who
            have a valid and active account with us. In order to qualify for an account, you
            must meet all eligibility criteria we set, including these:
            You must have passed our identity verification checks.
            Your place of residence must be a country or region where we make UTU
            accounts available.
            You must not have had a previous account which was terminated by us.
            You must not be a person prohibited from using UTU under these Terms of Use
            or Policies.<br>
            We reserve the right, in our sole and absolute discretion, not to allow anyone
            who applies for an account to create one, even if they meet the eligibility criteria,
            and/or to limit users only to individuals who reside in certain countries or regions.
            We also reserve the right, in our sole and absolute discretion, to terminate any
            userʼs account for any reason at any time. We may change our eligibility criteria,
            including by adding additional requirements, at any time with or without notice to
            you.<br>
            If you no longer meet our eligibility criteria at any time after you create an
            account, (including because of a change to our eligibility criteria), you must
            inform us and we may suspend or terminate your account.<br>
            4. ADDITIONAL ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA<br>
            No laws or other requirements that apply to you prohibit you from using any part
            of UTU or make it unlawful for you to use any part of UTU.
            You are not a citizen or resident of any country or region that is subject to any
            sanctions or other restrictions imposed or maintained by the United Nations, the
            United States, the European Union or its Member States, or other applicable
            government or international authorities (unless we, in our sole and absolute
            discretion, are satisfied that your use of UTU would not contravene any
            applicable law or regulation).<br>
            You do not appear on any list of prohibited, restricted or sanctioned persons or
            parties, including any such list maintained by the United Nations, the United
            States, the European Union or its Member States, or other applicable
            government or international authorities, and you are not part of a group that
            appears in such a list.<br>
            You are not at the relevant time in a country or region in which we do not permit
            access to UTU for any reason in our sole and absolute discretion, including but
            not limited to countries and regions mentioned in paragraph (b) above.
            We may implement geo-blocking measures that are designed to prevent access
            from any prohibited country or region. These measures may inadvertently block
            users who are not in a prohibited country or region from accessing UTU, but we
            assume no liability as a result.<br>
            If any of the above prohibitions did not apply to you when you started using
            UTU, but subsequently apply to you, you must immediately cease all use of UTU
            and, if you have already created an account, you must also immediately inform
            us by contacting our Help Center.<br>
            If you are not a citizen or resident of any country or region mentioned in
            paragraph (b) above, but you are temporarily present in any such country or
            region, then for so long as you are present in that country or region you must not
            use UTU.<br>
            5.COMPLETING OUR IDENTITY VERIFICATION PROCESS<br>
            As part of the sign-up process to open an account, you may be asked to
            complete an identity verification process by sharing certain personal information
            about yourself with us and/or any third-party service providers who we engage
            to conduct checks to verify and confirm your identity. Our third-party providers
            may be located and/or carry out their functions anywhere in the world. The
            information that we and/or our third-party service providers may request for this
            purpose include: <br>(i) your full legal name;  <br>(ii) your email address;  <br>(iii) your
            preferred name;  <br>(iv) your age, and  <br>(v) human signup information that uses
            liveness and face detection software to verify that you are real and physically
            present based on the ‘selfieʼ that you upload.<br>
            This information will be used by us and our third-party service providers to:
            verify your identity
            carry out checks with respect to money laundering, terrorist financing, fraud,
            financial crimes and other compliance matters, and
            enable us to comply with applicable laws and regulations and our internal
            policies.<br>
            As part of the sign-up process, you may be redirected to a site maintained by
            our third-party provider and submit the documentation required to verify your
            identity to our third-party provider. Our third-party provider may give us copies
            of all information that you have shared with them, including copies of any
            documents that you submitted to them. We store and process this information
            for limited purposes in accordance with our Privacy Notice.<br>
            You hereby authorize us and our appointed third parties to make all necessary
            inquiries (including to governmental, regulatory, law enforcement and other
            agencies around the world) that we or our third-party providers may deem
            necessary to verify your identity, to comply with applicable laws or regulations or
            to protect you and our other users, and to disclose information about you to
            governmental, regulatory, law enforcement and other agencies around the world.
            You hereby confirm and undertake that all information you provide to us and our
            third party service providers as part of the identity verification checks will be
            true, accurate and complete, and that all documents submitted by you as part of
            your account creation process will be authentic and not modified in any way.
            If we or our third-party service providers have any reason to believe that any
            information provided by you is wrong, inaccurate, outdated or incomplete, at any
            time,we may require you to provide corrected, updated and complete
            information. If you fail to comply with any such request, it will delay or even
            prevent the creation of your account (or where you already have an account,we
            may terminate your account).<br>
            We may, from time to time, require users to provide additional information or to
            undergo new identity verification checks, as a condition to their continued use of
            UTU and/or to be able to use certain features or functionalities of UTU. Please
            see our Privacy Notice to learn about the limited purposes we use this
            information for. We reserve the right to take any action referred to in Section 6.4
            with respect to any user who fails to comply with such a request.<br>
            6. OPENING AND ACCESSING YOUR UTU ACCOUNT<br>
            6.1 One Account Per Person<br>
            As an individual, you may only ever have a single UTU account at a given time.<br>
            6.2 Keeping Your Account Secure<br>
            Your account is personal to you. That means you must not allow any third party
            to use your account, ever. You should never share your account login details or
            passwords with anyone, and you should keep those safe and secure.
            If you know or suspect that anyone other than you has accessed your account,
            or you know or suspect that your account (including login and password details)
            has been compromised, you must notify us immediately by contacting our Help
            Center. Following such notification, and subject to any reasonable checks we
            may conduct to verify the authenticity of your notification,we may suspend your
            account and may require you to take other actions, including providing
            assistance to us with regards to any investigations that we may launch and
            setting up a new account (including undergoing the identity verification checks
            again).<br>
            We assume no responsibility or liability of whatever nature for any activities
            conducted through your account, including content posted on UTU or use of
            tokens.<br>
            6.3 If You Lose Access to Your Account<br>
            If you lose or forget your login or password details, you should contact our Help
            Center. We may require you to prove that you are who you say you are, and that
            the account belongs to you, before we take any action.<br>
            We may not be able to help you regain access to your account in all
            circumstances. If that is the case,we may (in our sole and absolute discretion)
            allow you to apply for a new account.However in those circumstances you will
            not be able to transfer anything (including tokens or records of activities) from
            your old account to your new account. If we can establish that your old account
            held any tokens,we may, in such an event and in our sole and absolute
            discretion, decide to credit you with such number of tokens as we see fit, but we
            are under no obligation to do so.<br>
            6.4 Our Powers in Respect of Your Account<br>
            We may take any measures we consider in our sole and absolute discretion
            appropriate with respect to your account, your use of UTU, your tokens and/or
            any user content generated by you on UTU,with or without notice to you,
            including in circumstances where we believe:<br>(i) you no longer meet any
            eligibility criteria; <br>(ii) you are in breach of these Terms of Use; <br>(iii) your account
            has been used or is being used in an unauthorized or fraudulent manner; <br>(iv)
            there is or is likely a breach of security or misuse of UTU because of your
            actions; <br>(v) it is necessary to protect us or any UTU users; <br>(vi) there is potential
            for any liability or harm; or <br>(vii) it is necessary to comply with any applicable law,
            regulation or policy. Such measures may be taken at any time,without notice
            and without giving reasons, and may include:<br>
            Termination – we may terminate your account and/or your ability to use UTU,
            and may also prevent you from creating a new account in future.<br>
            Removing content – we may remove, hide or restrict the availability or
            accessibility of any or all user content generated by you.<br>

            your account and/or cancel them.<br>
            Restrictions – we may temporarily or permanently prevent you from accessing
            your account, limit the actions you are allowed to take on UTU, freeze any tokens
            in your account or prevent you from receiving tokens.<br>
            Re-verifying identity – we may require you to redo the identity verification
            process.<br>
            6.5 Termination of Your Account at Your Request<br>
            You may ask us at any time to terminate your account by contacting our Help
            Center, or we may terminate your account in accordance with these Terms of
            Use.<br>
            6.6 Consequences of Termination<br>
            On termination of your account, you will not have any claim to any remaining
            tokens balance. We will be allowed to do with such tokens balance anything we
            see fit, including deleting, redistributing or burning those tokens.
            All user content created by means of your account will remain on UTU, subject
            to any applicable provisions of our Privacy Notice.<br>
            7.CONTENT, BEHAVIOR AND USING UTU<br>
            7.1 Your User Content is Visible to All<br>
            You understand that all user content created by means of your account will be
            visible to all users of UTU,with a hash of it being stored on the blockchain for
            auditability, and that it will be clear to anyone that the user content was created
            by your account and attributable to you (unless and until we enable anonymous
            posting, but even in that case we may be able to attribute user content to
            specific users).<br>
            7.2 Use UTU Yourself<br>
            You must use your account for yourself only and not on behalf of or for the
            benefit of any other person or entity.<br>
            7.3 User Content that includes intellectual property<br>
            Should you post user content that contains intellectual property of anyone else
            (for example, extracts from another publication, or video, audio or images
            created by someone else), you must, before you submit that as part of your user
            content, make sure that you have obtained all necessary rights and permissions
            to include that as part of your user content, and you must comply with any
            restrictions imposed by the rights holder.<br>
            Unauthorized use of third-party intellectual property is strictly prohibited and
            may expose you to legal action by the rights holder, as well as other sanctions
            described in these Terms of Use and other Policies.<br>
            7.4 User Content and Behavior<br>
            You must at all times comply with our Ground Rules with respect to your user
            content or behavior or when taking other actions allowed on UTU.
            We reserve the right in our sole and absolute discretion to take action (or not to
            take action) in accordance with the Ground Rules or these Terms of Use when
            we receive a report of potential breach.<br>
            7.5 You are Responsible for Your Account<br>
            You hereby agree that you are fully responsible and liable for all actions taken by
            you or by means of your account (including where third parties obtained access
            to your account). This means you are liable for, amongst other things:<br>
            all user content created by means of your account<br>
            all actions taken by means of tokens through your account, and<br>
            all other activities on UTU conducted through your account.<br>
            7.6 Prohibited use of UTU<br>
            You must not:<br>
            commit any act or omission that would cause you or us to be in breach of any
            applicable law or regulation, or any provision which we regard as similar, or use
            UTU in a manner that would be contrary to any laws that apply to you (which
            may be different from country to country)
            fail to abide by the Ground Rules or any other Policy in any way
            use UTU in a way that would negatively impact other users or other persons, or
            that could negatively impact the operation or functioning of UTU
            use another userʼs credentials to access UTU
            use UTU if you are prohibited from doing so by Section 4
            circumvent any features, functionality or security measures that we employ in
            UTU, including for example by using IP obscuring technologies like virtual private
            networks to prevent us determining the place from which you are using UTU
            gain unauthorized access to UTU, any server on which UTU is stored or
            operates or any server, computer or database connected to UTU
            introduce any viruses,worms, malware, trojan horses or other malicious, harmful
            or destructive content to UTU or another userʼs account
            introduce smart contracts, programs, executable code or other changes into
            UTU or any of the infrastructure supporting UTU

            or engage in any other action on UTU
            send automated or machine-generated queries or other content
            copy, distribute, modify or create derivative works of UTU or any content
            published on UTU, except that you may use a portion of another userʼs post on
            UTU when responding to or commenting on that post, provided you do so fairly
            and in accordance with our Ground Rules and applicable laws and regulations
            breach the security of UTU or attempt to do so
            publicly identify any security concerns of UTU and you should instead contact
            us immediately through our Help Center if you suspect any security concerns
            collect, harvest or otherwise use or obtain personal information of other users
            without their consent
            intentionally report user content or behavior as being in breach of our Ground
            Rules,without reasonable reason to believe so
            do or purport to do anything in breach of Section 8.3
            participate in any activities to manipulate rewards or tokens mechanisms that
            feature in UTU or artificially inflate rankings for posts, or
            attempt to do any of the foregoing or encourage or induce anyone else to
            engage in any prohibited uses of UTU.<br>
            7.7 User Content and Behavior on UTU<br>
            We may remove, hide, amend, preface, prohibit or otherwise moderate any user
            content or behavior where we deem it necessary or appropriate to do so,
            including where content or behavior breaches or is liable to be moderated by our
            Policies or could otherwise cause any liability or risk, but we are not obligated to
            do so.<br>
            User content and behaviour is moderated reactively in accordance with
            our Ground Rules and related Policies. We do not proactively moderate any user
            content (that is,we do not screen user content for compliance before it is
            posted) although we may do so at any time.<br>
            You acknowledge that user content represents the views of the user that posted
            that user content, and does not in any way mean that we endorse, sponsor,
            recommend, agree or encourage that user content or any underlying ideas or
            beliefs. We make no representation that the information or opinions provided on
            UTU are accurate, reliable or complete. We assume no responsibility or liability of
            whatever nature for any user content.<br>
            By posting user content on UTU, you grant us a perpetual, irrevocable,
            worldwide, royalty-free, and non-exclusive license to use, reproduce, modify,
            distribute, publish, process and adapt your user content for the purposes of
            providing it on UTU and promoting us and any other products or services
            offered by or associated with us (including UTU),without providing you with any
            notice or compensation or requiring your consent, except as required by law.
            Your user content will be visible to other users (and potentially to other third
            parties) who may if permitted by applicable law or regulation share or duplicate
            your user content on UTU or elsewhere.<br>
            Where we provide you with the ability to delete user content, or where we delete
            user content,we will use reasonable efforts to remove it from UTU.However, you
            acknowledge that it may not be possible to delete all instances of user content
            (e.g. in caches) and that user content may remain available on our servers and

            Facebook, Twitter, etc.) by, for example, reposting user content from UTU onto
            such third-party services and platforms. Other users may do the same thing
            with your user content.Use of those third-party services and platforms is
            governed by their respective terms of service, not by these Terms of Use. When
            you post any user content (whether yours or another userʼs) you bear the sole
            and exclusive responsibility for complying with such other terms of service.<br>
            7.8 Third-party content<br>
            We may display third-party content, advertisements, links, promotions, logos
            and other materials on UTU for your convenience. We do not approve of, control,

            8. RECEIVING AND USING UTU TOKENS<br>
            8.1 Introduction<br>
            Users who have an active UTU account may receive tokens in connection with
            their use of UTU.Users who do not have a UTU account will not be eligible for or
            receive tokens.<br>
            The number of tokens available to you to use is indicated in your UTU account
            as your token balance.UTU tokens are designed solely for use on UTU and may
            not be used for other purposes.<br>
            In this Section,we describe what tokens are and explain their nature (and
            specifically, that tokens are beta tokens, not intended to be a currency,
            cryptocurrency, security, commodity, investment or anything similar).
            We may, at any time and in our sole and absolute discretion, decide to change
            the nature of tokens, revoke all or some tokens (with or without replacing them
            with something else) or cease the use of tokens altogether. We will inform you of
            any such changes.<br>
            8.2 How to Receive UTU Tokens<br>
            You may receive tokens in a number of different ways, such as:
            Daily allocation – you may receive a daily allocation of tokens if you are an active
            user, in such number and at such times as determined by us in our sole and
            absolute discretion (which may be changed by us at any time).
            UTU It, Like Rewards and other features and functions – you may receive tokens
            through UTU It, Like Rewards or other features and functionalities provided on
            UTU.<br>
            From us – we may, in our sole and absolute discretion, decide to give you tokens
            for any reason, including (by way of example only): <br>(i) as part of any promotional
            activities; or <br>(ii) where we allow you to create a new UTU account after your
            previous account has become inaccessible.<br>
            Tokens that you are eligible to receive will not necessarily appear in your UTU
            account as part of your available token balance. We may require you to use a
            specific feature, take certain actions or fulfil any other additional requirements in
            order for you to receive them into your available token balance, and we may
            impose time limits for doing so. A failure to comply with any requirements within
            any specified time limit may mean you will not receive those tokens and you will
            have no right to claim for such tokens.<br>
            We reserve the right to treat certain users differently when it comes to the
            allocation of tokens. The fact that some users receive tokens under certain
            circumstances does not allow other users any right or claim to receive similar
            tokens or to receive tokens under similar circumstances.<br>
            We reserve the right, at any time and in our sole discretion (with or without
            notice), <br>(i) to change, terminate or revoke the functions, features and/or
            permissible uses of tokens, <br>(ii) to change the manner in which some or all users
            receive tokens and/or the number of tokens received through UTU It or other
            means <br>(iii) to cease any of the means by which users may receive tokens,<br> (iv) to
            impose or relax requirements with respect to receiving or using tokens and to
            determine whether any requirements have been complied with,<br> (v) to receive
            and use tokens ourselves (or through our affiliates) at such times and in such
            amounts as we see fit, <br>(vi) to adjust or reset the token balance on your UTU
            account (including resetting it to zero), and <br>(vii) to create new types of tokens for
            use on UTU.<br>
            There is no ability to buy or otherwise acquire tokens through trades (whether
            for money or other consideration), nor is there any ability for you to “mine” or
            independently generate tokens. The fact that you may have received tokens in
            the past does not give you any expectation or right to receive tokens in the
            future.<br>
            8.3 How to Use UTU Tokens<br>
            UTU tokens may be used only on UTU, and only for the purposes specifically
            allowed on UTU. Any other use is strictly prohibited. Your use of tokens will be
            fully visible to all other UTU users and will be attributable to you. You can never
            use more tokens than the number of tokens available in your token balance on
            your UTU account.<br>
            We reserve the right, in our sole and absolute discretion, to change the way in
            which users may use tokens.<br>
            We reserve the right in our sole and absolute discretion to reverse any use of
            tokens or any other action with respect to tokens, for any reason or for no reason
            whatsoever and with or without notice to any user concerned.<br>
            You must not:
            buy, sell, trade or exchange tokens for real currency, cryptocurrency or any other
            consideration,
            “gift” tokens or accept tokens,whether on UTU or outside of
            UTU. The only exception to this rule is where tokens are provided by one user to
            another by means of and in accordance with UTU It or other features and
            functionalities and the Policies governing those features and functionalities,
            agree to use, or use, tokens (including as permitted on UTU) in return for any
            consideration, promise, gift or otherwise offered by any other person (whether a
            user or not), or make any proposal to any other person to use their tokens in
            return for any consideration, promise, gift or otherwise,
            use tokens as any form of collateral or security,whether on UTU or outside of
            UTU, or pledge or encumber tokens in any way (or make any commitment to do
            so),
            create, or become engaged in any way, in any “grey market” in connection with
            tokens,
            use tokens in any manner that is prohibited under any applicable law (including
            any fraudulent activity, money laundering, financing of terrorists or other
            unlawful activity), or
            attempt to do, or facilitate, any of the foregoing or encourage or induce anyone
            else to engage in any of the foregoing.
            Any breach of this Section 8, however small, shall be a material breach that may
            result in the immediate termination of your account and result in you being
            permanently banned from UTU.<br>
            8.4 Nature of UTU Tokens<br>
            Tokens are in beta. Tokens are purely an incidental feature of UTU and have no
            application outside of UTU. Tokens are not intended to be, constitute or
            represent, anywhere in the world, any form of:
            currency, general cryptocurrency, deposit, stored value facility, stablecoin,
            multifunctional digital asset, commodity, interest in a collective investment
            scheme, security, financial instrument, electronic money, regulated instrument,
            regulated asset, or similar,
            property (including intellectual property),
            interest in or entitlement to use UTU, any of the features that form part of UTU or
            any related assets, or
            right (enforceable or otherwise) or expectation of whatever nature against us,
            any of our affiliates, any user or any other person.
            However,we make no warranty or representation in this regard.
            Tokens are not redeemable for cash or any other form of consideration and have
            nil monetary value. We expressly disclaim any monetary value. You should not
            treat tokens as a speculative investment or any other sort of investment.
            Tokens are not guaranteed or secured by any person, asset, entity, organization,
            scheme, venture or project (including UTU) in any way and no person is obliged
            to redeem or purchase them.<br>
            No service or other relationship shall be created between you (on the one side)
            and us, any of our affiliates, any other user or any other person (on the other
            side) in respect of any activities carried out by means of tokens.
            Any incidental benefit obtained by us, any of our affiliates or any other person
            from or as a result of your use of tokens is voluntarily provided by you and you
            shall not have any right or claim to be compensated for that benefit.
            We do not provide or facilitate, and users are prohibited from using tokens in
            connection with: (i) an online digital asset trading platform for UTU tokens; (ii)
            any investment services (including portfolio management services or
            investment advice); (iii) any deposit-taking services; (iv) any payment or money
            transmission services; or (v) any gambling, gaming or lottery services.
            No information contained on UTU or otherwise communicated to you by us or
            any of our affiliates is intended to form the basis of any investment decision or to
            amount to an investment recommendation and/or investment advice.UTU is not
            intended to constitute an offer or solicitation to buy or sell a security or any other
            financial instrument or electronic money or to engage in any regulated service or
            activity.<br>
            8.5 Our rights with respect to UTU Tokens<br>
            You have no property or right in, over or to tokens and we reserve the right, in our
            sole and absolute discretion, and at any time (for any reason or for no reason
            whatsoever) to:
            restrict your ability to use tokens in any manner we deem fit, even where you
            have a positive token balance, or
            reduce or increase your or any other userʼs token balance by such number of
            tokens as we deem fit (including to zero).
            To the extent that there exists any intellectual property rights in tokens, all of
            those rights are reserved entirely and exclusively by us and our affiliates and no
            person (including a user) shall be granted any right or license therein.<br>
            8.6 Tax<br>
            We do not make any representation,warranty or otherwise whether or not your
            receipt or use of tokens will be subject to any taxation of whatever nature by any
            authority anywhere in the world. You should obtain independent advice with
            respect to all tax and other implications concerning tokens (including their
            receipt or use) and shall be solely responsible for your own tax affairs.
            Under no circumstances shall we or any of our affiliates be liable to you or any
            other person whatsoever, for any tax or similar consequences arising from your
            or their receipt or use of tokens, or to provide any assistance to you or other
            persons with respect to the preparation or filing of any statutory or other forms
            or submissions to any tax or other authority.<br>
            8.7 Regulatory standing<br>
            We do not make any representation or warranty of whatever nature regarding
            any requirement for you to register or obtain any kind of license or other consent
            from any governmental, regulatory or tax authority anywhere in the world in
            connection with your use of UTU or the use or receipt of tokens. You should
            obtain independent advice with respect to your regulatory standing and shall be
            solely responsible for your own compliance with any regulatory rules that may
            apply to you.<br>
            9.CONSEQUENCES OF USING BLOCKCHAIN<br>
            UTU utilizes blockchain technology to store information concerning user
            activities on UTU. By storing information on the blockchain,we are able to
            ensure there is proof that those activities took place on UTU.
            We currently use a private blockchain (i.e. a blockchain that is managed and
            controlled entirely by us and/or our affiliates) that we call the UTU Chain to
            support UTU. We may allow anyone who wishes to have access to the UTU
            Chain (including you) to obtain such access. We may also, in our sole and
            absolute discretion, decide not to allow access to anyone, for any reason or for
            no reason.<br>
            You are not required to have access to the UTU Chain to be able to use UTU.
            However,where you do request access and we allow that, your access and use
            is governed by these Terms of Use. You:
            agree to access the UTU Chain only through designated access points provided
            by us, and not by any other means
            shall not allow any other person to obtain access to the UTU Chain through the
            means made available to you
            shall not make any attempt to modify, alter, edit or delete any part of the UTU
            Chain, including through the deployment of any smart contracts on the UTU
            Chain or by integrating any software into any part of the UTU Chain
            may not reproduce any part of the UTU Chain to mislead, defraud or otherwise
            commit malicious acts against any person (whether criminal or not) or as part of
            any scam
            shall not publicly distribute or create derivative works of any part of the UTU
            Chain
            shall not make any attempt to bypass any security or other measures
            implemented by us in connection with the UTU Chain, or
            take any steps intended to obtain personal information from the information
            posted to the UTU Chain.
            All restrictions and prohibitions concerning the use of UTU, including those set
            out in Sections 7.6 and 12, shall apply similarly to your access and use of the
            UTU Chain.
            We have no responsibility to teach you how to access or otherwise use the UTU
            Chain or blockchain in general.
            We may in future use any other blockchain, including a public blockchain (i.e. a
            blockchain that is not managed and controlled by us), to support UTU and the
            terms of this Section shall equally apply to your access to such blockchain
            insofar as it concerns UTU.<br>
            10. LIABILITY, EXCLUSION AND INDEMNITY<br>
            Release<br>
            We are not responsible and will not become involved in any disputes between
            users on or in connection with UTU. If you have a dispute with any other user,
            you release us, our affiliates and their affiliates as well as our third-party service
            providers, and each of our and their respective officers, directors, agents, jointventurers, employees and representatives, from any and all claims, demands
            and damages (actual and consequential) of every kind and nature arising out of
            or in any way connected with such disputes.<br>
            Where you require us, in accordance with applicable law, to become involved in
            any dispute between you and a user, you agree to fund all reasonable costs of
            our involvement.<br>
            10.2 No warranties<br>
            UTU is provided “as is” without warranty or condition of any kind, either express
            or implied, including, but not limited to, the implied terms of satisfactory quality,
            merchantability or fitness for a particular purpose.
            Without limiting the foregoing,we make no warranty or condition that: (i) UTU
            will meet your requirements; (ii) UTU will always be available or uninterrupted,
            timely, secure, free of viruses or error-free; (iii) the results that may be obtained
            from the use of UTU will be effective, accurate or reliable; and (iv) the quality of
            any materials purchased or obtained by you from UTU will meet your
            expectations.<br>
            Where applicable law of any state or jurisdiction that applies to you does not
            allow us to exclude implied terms or to introduce limitations on how long an
            implied warranty may last, the above limitations may not apply to you and,
            instead, all implied warranties are excluded insofar as applicable law allows us to
            exclude them and limited to the minimum period mandated by those applicable
            laws.<br>
            10.3 Exclusion of liability<br>
            The exclusion of liability in this Section applies whether or not we have been
            advised of the possibility of losses or damages.<br>
            We will not be liable in contract, tort (including negligence), statutory duty or
            otherwise, for any losses or damage,whether direct or indirect (including loss of
            profits, loss of goodwill, loss of revenue or savings, loss of assets, loss of
            business, loss of anticipated benefit or loss of opportunity), or for any
            consequential, special, punitive or incidental loss or damage of whatever nature,
            in each case that may result from use of UTU.
            Without prejudice to the above,we will not be responsible or liable to you or any
            other person in contract, tort (including negligence), statutory duty or otherwise
            for any loss or damage arising from:
            anything caused by you, such as forgotten passwords or login details, incorrectly
            constructed transactions, or mistyped content or instructions
            server failure or data loss or leakage (howsoever caused)
            corrupted data or files
            unauthorised access, or
            third party activities, including the use of viruses, phishing, brute forcing or other
            means of attack against UTU.<br>
            Where any applicable law prohibits us from excluding our liability to the extent
            set out in this Section, our liability shall be excluded to the maximum extent
            allowed under applicable law.<br>
            10.4 Limitation of liability<br>
            In no event will our cumulative liability to you,whether in contract, tort (including
            negligence), or otherwise, exceed the greater of:
            the aggregate amount you paid to us to access or use UTU in the most recent
            three-month period (if applicable), or
            US$50, unless applicable law prohibits us from limiting our liability to this extent,
            in which case our liability shall be limited to the minimum amount that applicable
            law imposes on us.<br>
            10.5 Saving clause<br>
            Nothing in these Terms of Use excludes or limits our liability to you where we are
            not allowed to exclude or limit liability under applicable law, including where any
            special protection is afforded specifically to consumers by mandatory provisions
            of the law of your place of residence. This includes liability for death or personal
            injury arising from our negligence or the negligence of our employees, agents or
            sub-contractors, or for fraud or fraudulent misrepresentation.<br>
            10.6 Indemnification<br>
            You agree to indemnify and hold us, our affiliates and service providers, and
            each of our or their respective officers, directors, managers, agents, jointventurers, employees and representatives, harmless from any claim or demand
            (including legal fees and any fines, fees or penalties imposed by any regulatory
            authority) arising out of or related to your use of UTU, your account, your user
            content, your breach of these Terms of Use, or any Policies, or your violation of
            any duty, obligation, law, rule or regulation, or the rights of any third party.<br>

            12. SYSTEMS AND SECURITY<br>
            12.1 Systems<br>
            UTU is run on technology systems (hardware, software, databases and the like)
            selected and maintained by us or our subcontractors and third-party providers.
            We may change these technology systems from time to time, including by
            updating or upgrading them, replacing them with other systems, removing
            systems, adding new systems and changing the location at which any of these
            systems are located or hosted. We may also appoint sub-contractors and other
            third-party providers to perform functions in relation to the operation of UTU. We
            may do so for any reason or for no reason whatsoever, and at any time. We will
            not provide any notice to you of any such changes or appointments.
            You are responsible for making all arrangements necessary for you to have
            access to UTU, including the technology necessary to access and use UTU (e.g.
            computer and compatible browser for the internet version and a compatible
            mobile or similar device where you access UTU via one of our apps).
            Where you download and install any UTU app made available by us, you may be
            required to accept additional terms applicable to the use of that app. Your ability
            to continue accessing UTU via such an app will be subject to us continuing to
            make that app available and you complying with all of the Policies governing
            your use of that app.<br>
            12.2 Security<br>
            We do not guarantee that UTU will be secure or free from bugs or viruses and all
            limitations on and exclusions to our liability in respect of security is limited in
            accordance with Section 10. You should use your own virus protection software
            and continuously update your anti virus definitions and libraries, and ensure all
            software (including browsers and any app that we may make available to you)
            that you use to access UTU is up to date<br>
            You must not attack UTU including,without limitation, via a denial-of-service
            attack or a distributed denial-of service attack. By breaching this provision, you
            could commit a criminal offense under the UK Computer Misuse Act, the US
            Computer Fraud and Abuse Act, or similar laws. We will report any such breach
            to the relevant law enforcement authorities and we will cooperate with those
            authorities by disclosing your identity to them. In the event of such a breach,
            your right to use UTU will cease immediately.<br>

            We also reserve the right, in our sole and absolute discretion, to terminate these
            Terms of Use and our agreement with you for any reason at any time, including

            14.4 Entire agreement<br>
            These Terms of Use, together with the Policies and other notices on UTU, make

            UTU. These Terms of Use supersede any prior or contemporaneous
            agreements, communications and proposals,whether oral or written, between
            you and us (including, but not limited to, any prior versions of these Terms of
            Use).<br>

            from the remainder. A determination that provisions are unlawful, void or
            unenforceable will not affect the validity and enforceability of any other
            remaining provisions.<br>

            these forward-looking statements. Actual results, performance or events may
            differ materially from what is predicted in the forward-looking statements. Some
            of the factors that could cause actual results, performance or events to differ
            materially from the forward-looking statements include,without limitation:
            technical feasibility and barriers; market trends and volatility; continued
            availability of capital, financing and personnel; product acceptance; the
            commercial success of any new products or technologies; competition; existing,
            new and changing regulation and laws; actions or decisions of government
            agencies or authorities; and general economic, market or business conditions.

            obligation to, and expressly disclaims any obligation to, update or alter any
            statements,whether as a result of new information, subsequent events or
            otherwise. Nothing that we publish constitutes technological, financial,

            particular situation or implementation. Please consult with experts in appropriate
