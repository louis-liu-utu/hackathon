        <h1 class="main-title">Ground Rules</h1>
        <p class="main-txt">
            UTU is a platform where content creators can share their work with the world at large and where community
            members can engage in civil discussions with real people. Because UTU doesn’t allow bots or spam accounts on
            the platform, fake news and illegitimate content is dramatically decreased through the ability to attribute
            everything to a specific person.
        </p>
        <p class="main-txt">
            UTU has a deep and abiding respect for freedom of expression and the transformative power of robust debate
            in the marketplace of ideas. 
            That said, our commitment to bolstering freedom of expression doesn’t mean anything goes. There are still
            restrictions as to what you can say and do on the platform. Some of them come from our legal obligations not
            to host certain categories of content. Others are designed to uphold our common values of openness and
            respect in the earnest pursuit of truth.
        </p>
        <p class="main-txt">
            UTU, the platform, owns the responsibility of enforcing policies and laws governing certain forms of speech.
            These Ground Rules prioritize limiting only those forms of speech that are legally objectionable or that
            present a clear and present danger to the UTU community. 
        </p>
        <p class="main-txt">
            UTU’s Trust and Safety team will take relevant actions to ensure compliance with applicable laws and the
            safety of UTU’s community. For example, UTU may be legally required, or may be compelled to act in the
            interest of user safety, to remove content that violates the Ground Rules.
        </p>
        <p class="main-txt">
            However, any restriction on speech must be justified by a thoughtful determination that the speech has the
            potential to cause measurable harm.
        </p>
        <p class="main-txt">
            These Ground Rules provide a baseline of the types of speech we believe would be likely to cause tangible
            harm to UTU or its users if left unregulated. They are intentionally minimalistic, and our aim is to apply
            them transparently and consistently, while we work earnestly to build the tools needed to empower our
            communities to self-moderate much of this content. 
        </p>
        <p class="main-txt">
            UTU will always have a responsibility to remove illegal content or any content posing legal risk to the
            platform.  As we roll out tools and mechanisms for community self-moderation on the platform, it will be
            increasingly possible for the UTU community to judge and take action on content that does not pose a legal
            risk. 
        </p>
        <p class="main-txt">
            We will not play politics with content moderation. We choose to empower our communities instead. 
        </p>
        <p class="main-txt">
            The first version of our Ground Rules was developed by the founding UTU community, and the community will
            continue to shape our Ground Rules in the future. The UTU community will have an ongoing forum to
            participate in developing our Ground Rules—the format of these forums also being shaped by community input
            as UTU grows. This is a living and breathing set of guidelines that will continue to evolve and change over
            time as the UTU community expands to new audiences, and as UTU rolls out new features and opportunities to
            empower the community to uphold content standards.
            We plan to regularly review and update UTU’s Ground Rules to ensure that they are reflective of our evolving
            community values, and consistently contributing to the UTU community’s safety and satisfaction.
            Both new and pre-existing content and behaviour on UTU will always be tested against the current version. 
            The version accessible at this URL will always be the current one.

            The following are guidelines for acceptable content and conduct on UTU developed in partnership between the

        <p class="main-txt">
            We generally evaluate text and images under the same standard, but due to the potential for harm from
            unwanted exposure, there are some additional considerations for images and videos.

                Consequences: What Happens When I Break the Ground Rules?
            </p>
            <p class="main-txt">
                If you publish a post or do something else that breaks one or more of these Ground Rules, we will delete
                the offending post from the platform, and you will be given a “strike” for the violation. 
            </p>
            <p class="main-txt">
                Your first strike will result in a warning. Successive strikes will result in escalating penalties, from
                a temporary freeze (referred to as a “Mute”) on your ability to interact with the UTU community up to
                and including the termination of your UTU account.
            </p>
            <p class="main-txt">
                Mute Mode means that your ability to engage in the UTU community will be severely limited. Essentially,
                your account is placed into a read-only state. You are not able to post, comment, UTU, like, follow or
                unfollow, and collect or earn. No previously collected tokens will be removed from your account, but you
                will be unable to collect new ones until the Mute has ended.
            </p>
            <p class="main-txt">
                The penalty progression will generally look like this:
            </p>
            <p class="main-txt">
                Strike 1: Warning
            </p>

                Strike 2: 24 Hour Mute

                Strike 6: Permanent termination of your UTU account
            </p>
            <p class="main-txt">
                You will be notified of the moderation action via email. The notice you receive will include a reference
                to the specific rule you broke, a reminder of your current strike count, and an explanation of how you
                can appeal the decision.

                Note that the consequences apply to most violations of our Ground Rules, but there are certain
                categories of violation that fall under a Zero Tolerance policy and will result in immediate
                termination. We reserve this approach for the most egregious offenses, including:

                Also note that some legal frameworks may require UTU to take punitive action outside the general
                Consequences listed above. Notably, our Copyright Policy requires us to implement a repeat infringer
                protocol that relies on a seperate strike criteria for repeated copyright violations.

                Appeals: How Do I Challenge a Strike?
            </p>
            <p class="main-txt">
                Our moderators strive to be thorough and consistent, but mistakes do happen. We are always willing to
                reconsider a moderation decision, and you are more than welcome to appeal.
            </p>
            <p class="main-txt">
                An appeal is a way for you to tell us that you feel that we interpreted the Ground Rules wrongly when we
                examined your post. Maybe there was some extra context we failed to consider. Maybe we simply clicked
                the wrong button. By submitting an appeal you can present us with new information, clarifications, or
                explain your reasoning for why you think we made the wrong call. We don’t promise to agree, but we will
                consider your appeal. 
            </p>
            <p class="main-txt">
                An appeal is not a way for you to tell us that you disagree with the existence of a rule, or that you
                are really very sorry/it will never happen again/you would really like to come out of Mute/etc.
            </p>
            <p class="main-txt">
                If successful, the strike associated with your account is instantly removed and your account is removed
                from Mute.
            </p>
            <p class="main-txt">
                If unsuccessful, there are no additional penalties but the associated strike remains in place and the
                account stays in Mute.
            </p>
            <p class="main-txt">
                You can submit an appeal here, or via email to appeals@utu.one. Please include a link to where the
                deleted post used to be and an explanation as to why you think we made the wrong decision deleting it. 
                You can only appeal once in relation to any moderation decision.
